# SVG-Logo-Maker-Homework10
Make a command-line application to create a logo upon demand.  Homework Challenge -Week 10 - 

# Description
The purpose of designing this app is to give people a fast, easy and inexpensive way to create a 3 character logo for their use. The app works quite simply
by asking the user a series of questions that they can enter the answer for.  Once all the answers are entered, the app then generates the logo.
The user gets to choose from 3 shapes: a circle, square or triange.  They also have the option of background color and character color. Color can be chosen by entering
a color by name or by hexadecimal number. Once the choices are made, and 3 characters are picked the logo is generated.  The logo is in the form of a svg file, thus 
giving the user options on how they want to encorporate the logo into their work.
